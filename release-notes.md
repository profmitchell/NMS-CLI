## NMSE - No Man's Save Editor v1.3.16

### Changelog

_**It's another pretty big one with a lot going on under the hood.**_

Happy NMS 10th Anniversary everyone! 🥳
(Special hello to all the Project Skyscraper Operators out there 😉)

#### Features:

- **DB and mappings updated for Game Update 7.03 (Cosmos).**
    - Adds all the new items, rewards, tools, ships, parts, etc. from the update and expedition.
- Add new items types (such as space station buildables) to the Inventory item picker system.
- Added support for Space Station ownership acceleration.
- Added support for Space Station bases and Space bases.
- Added support for Space POI system:
    - Note: There is an algorithm involved in unpacking the data used for this and NMSE captures it on first load of a save. This means that the earlier the system is in exploration, the more accurate NMSE can resolve the POI types to the slots. Even if it can't identify it (not enough pattern info), it can still change the states without issue.
    - Makes Space POIs determinable.
    - Makes Space POI state able to be changed (Hidden, Undiscovered, Discovered, Complete) - they can never be changed to lower than their starting state (so no hiding the stars!).
- Added 'Discoveries' library system.
    - Creates a folder and stores discovery based info.
    - Currently only used for Space POIs, but will be extended to collections and discoveries in the future.
- Added support to the Raw JSON Editor for an isolated node view in split view mode (allows you to view only that nodes code). (per FR #118)
- Added a Database Search panel that allows users to search the loaded item database without needing to load a save.
    - Shows additional hidden data.
    - Allows for wildcard searching.
- Added Catalogue Completion system to the catalogue panel set, which allows you to manage the in game catalogue UI completion independent of unlocks.
    - Adds Wonders, Collected Knowledge, Fossils, Raw Materials and Discovery Stats management.
    - Extends cross support into the other Known* panels etc.
- Improvements to some underlying code and some other cleanup tasks (non-user-facing).

#### Bug Fixes:

- Fix for Consistency Dialog and DataView trimming crashes. (per Issue #121 & Discord report)
- Fix for Switch format save meta files. (per Discord report)
- Fix for Preset game mode selection UI bug.
- Fix for Xbox blob date/time race condition resulting in wrong date in UI. (per Issue #122)
- Fix for themes not saving to config for reload. (per Issue #117)

<br />

### Changelog 1.2.7

#### Features:

- **DB and mappings updated for Game Update 6.45.1 (The Swarm) to include the three trophies**

- Added active context switching / handling for base vs expedition save structures (improves use in Expedition saves).
- Added player outfit selector and export / import support (see new extension in Export Config panel). (per NMScord request)
- Added A->Z / Z->A sorting to the Bases list.
- Added ability to delete bases. 9Per FR #104)
- Increased system index to support the whole range (0-4095) instead of the older low range (phantom blocks, Purple Systems, etc. are now reachable via the UI). (per Issue #105)
- Added "MAX" button to currencies. (per FR #103)
- Added "GOTO JSON" System (per FR #67):
    - Each panel that has a *sensible* section of JSON to navigate to has a button for it in the top right of that panel.
    - The GOTO JSON button will send you to the Raw JSON Editor to the "master" key for the section.
    - Hover over the button to see the tooltip for what section it is sending you to.
    - The system is limited to certain sets of master keys / values / arrays to keep things sensible and manageable - it may be extended in the future.
    - While using it to jump to a JSON block can't hurt your save - please consider it an advanced use feature. Bug reports are welcome.

    - Allows viewing details and deleting stations.
    - Lists separate stations around the galaxies and those in your bases.
- Added "Known Recipes" panel to the Recipes panel in the Catalogue that functions similarly to the other "Known" Catalogue panels. (per FR #96)
- Added _**EXPERIMENTAL**_ Multiplayer panel to the MainStats panel. It provides:
    - Viewing of the co-op / team multiplayer keys.
    - **NOTE:** Most are overridden by the game and functionality is not guaranteed.<br/>
      Given the testing/issues for this game update, the stability and use of these keys is likely to change as HG tweak this concept for future use.
    - This panel may be locked down or removed in the future.
- Inventory grid panel has had a rework of the Item Picker pane, moving the search above the information per user feedback poll. (per FR #99)

<br />

### Changelog 1.1.79 (preview)

#### Features:

- AppConfig (`NMSE.conf`) moved to be alongside the executable - attempts a one time best effort config transition from the old directory. (per FR #86)
- Sails for Solar ships added to the Customisation tab (the colour change is local only as the game shows default blue in multiplayer for fabricated ships). (per FR #90)
- Ship Customisation tab UI rearranged and some names changed to better match in-game names. (per FR #91)
- Pet Battle ability list has a restricted move system to support abilities that HG remove from the UI but keep in the data. (per Issue #82)
    - `REVIVE` is now no longer selectable as a new ability and only displayed for companions that currently have it assigned. It was removed by HG and forwarded to a STUB ability.
- The application now subscribes to per-monitor DPI settings. (per Issue #88)
- Some localisation strings updated across different languages.
- Updater pattern changed for potentially better handling when run in synced folders (OneDrive, Dropbox, Drive, iCloud, Box, pCloud, SugarSync, etc.). (per Issue #85)
    - Updater call methods hardened.
    - Folder checks for known sync folders.
    - Back-off and timeout update options to help with file lock during sync hashing.
- Updated additional PS4 format support (HTOS .hg, SW bin-wrap .hg). The 6x PS4 formats still need proper user testing for the non `.dat` formats.
- Improved backup management under restricted environments and compatibility layers.

#### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed companion pet body part descriptors not being deep copied to an egg when it is induced. (per Issue #89)
- Numerous buttons and fields updated for high res high scale setups (such as 4K @ 150%). (per Issue #88)
- Some DataModified events weren't being captured to notify the user to save changes if they were closing after changes. These are now fixed. (per Issue #87)
- ZIP backups now only check and include `.hg` files specifically, instead of the current directory, helping with backups when users load a save file from a weird place with many files, such as sitting on a bloated desktop, or in the root of a drive.
- Fixed some name updates not refreshing from the underlying JSON layer when changed. Including Base name not being reflected until reload. (per Issue #92)
- Fixed ship type change not being refreshed visually in the prefix in the ship list, or in the scene resource field despite the underlying data being modified successfully.
- Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> in a field now commits the data immediately to the in memory data and ends focus in the field, instead of only clicking to change focus, or using <kbd>Tab</kbd>. (per Issue #92)

<br />

### Changelog 1.1.64 (preview)

#### Features:

- "Clear All Terrain Except Base" added to the Bases panel - allows clearing of terrain edits, excluding edits tied to bases. (Per Issue #78) 
- Magic bytes / headers for multiple PS4 save formats updated to newer versions to support more up to date formats.
- Starship Archive support added. (Per Issue #3) Allows:
    - Importing of archived ships into the active list from the games archived ships slots.
    - Moving of a starship to the archived ships list from the active list.
- Multi-tool Archive support added. (Per Issue #3) Allows:
    - Importing of archived multi-tools into the active list from the games archived multi-tool slots.
    - Moving of a multi-tool to the archived multi-tool list from the active list.
> Archives Caveat: <br />
> Archives arrays store procedural names to string when stored in game, but standard arrays don't under any normal circumstances. <br />
> This means they may display with no name if archived from the editor with a procgen name as the editor cannot generate the names. <br />
> There is no way around this without reverse engineering the name generation markov assembler and robinhood tables.

#### Bug Fixes:

- Syncing of `Seen*` arrays removed from the rewards sync process so catalogued seen items aren't affected by items that aren't unlocked. Will be used for a future "seen" panel.

<br />

- Added release notes to and improved the new update available popup dialog (from this build onwards). (Per FR #46)
- Added the ability to re-order bases in the teleport list (and array list) - note: the game will still replace the first few with "immediate local teleports" in the UI, such as close-by bases and freighters. This seems unavoidable. (Per FR #73)
- Added ability to remove all terrain edits in the save from the Bases panel. (Per FR#66)
- Backup management cleaned up. `.backup` files are no longer produced / used in favour of the `.zip` backups.
- Progression levels added to the Guilds milestones and minor milestones re-arrangement / cleanup. (Per FR #68)
- Added ability to enable Purple System warping from the Player -> General -> Current Coordinates section (enables the warping and adds the drive to KnownTech). (Per FR #77)

    - Modification of the scene resource (model) filename for all ships for ship glitching (like orbs).
    - Modification of customisation options for player built ships.

#### Bug Fixes:

- Additional filter changes to the "Check Consistency" dialog box sync list (Per Issue #64)

<br />

### Changelog 1.1.52 (preview)

#### Bug Fixes:

- The "Check Consistency" button in Account Rewards has had the comparison list tightened based on further analysis of the `Known*`, etc. arrays. It will now show substantially less potential items for manual syncing across state arrays. More changes may come soon to further tighten this list. (Per Issue #64)
- The "Check Consistency" dialog box now shows a basic warning message. (Per Issue #64)
- Advanced save utility has had it's slot management logic updated to fix incorrect slots/files being managed when moving/swapping/copying/deleting. (Per Issue #63)

#### Bug Fixes:

- Fix for importing to empty slot for NMS Model IO Tool exported corvettes by adding a base data structure rebuilder for the base JSON node (these files don't include full base data - only object data). In theory this fix will also allow other malformed corvette imports with varying degrees of success - your mileage may vary importing malformed data.

<br />

### Changelog 1.1.48 (preview) - hotfix

#### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug with French special character ranges U+0080 - U+00FF (e.g. éèàç) being parsed/written correctly after the unicode change in the JSON parser.

Affected users will unfortunately need to re-enter these names as the fix cannot be made 'self-healing' in this case. Sorry about that French friends!

<br />

### Changelog 1.1.47 (preview) - hotfix

#### Bug Fixes:

This is a quick hotfix to correct bulk recharge skipping procedural technology items due to not filtering the seed suffix from the item ID.
Apologies everyone!

<br />

### Changelog 1.1.46 (preview) - hotfix

#### Bug Fixes:

#### Bug Fixes:

- Backend and rendering of the Inventory Grid has been rewritten to reduce handles, drastically lowering them to 10% of previous use and protecting against potential edge case crashes preemptively.
- Rewards no longer subscribe to a sync event automatically, allowing users to keep out of sync reward/known* arrays. Syncing is still available via editing a reward/known or by using the Check Consistency button.
- Raw number guards extended via the NUD replacement and additional changes to panel calls. (per Issue #56)
- All string based numbers in the save are now managed in multiple logic layers for a double (backend) decimal (frontend) round-trip to avoid actual precision loss, or perceived precision loss via G17 and custom handling. (per Issue #56)
- Supported Game Version label in auto build fixed. (per Discord Bug Report)
- Overall tweaks to memory management and JSON object handling (not user facing).
- Minor change to unicode symbols handling (not user facing).

#### Features:

- JSON key mappings update for Game Update 6.33.
- Minor DB updates for Game Update 6.33.
